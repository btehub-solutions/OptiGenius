# Fix "Failed" GitHub Checks - Quick Action Plan

## 🎯 Problem
Commits showing ❌ Failed on GitHub because Vercel can't build without environment variables.

## ✅ Solution (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel
**Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Add these 5 variables** (check all: Production, Preview, Development):

#### 1. DATABASE_URL
```
postgres://default:xxx@xxx-pooler.us-east-1.postgres.vercel-storage.com/verceldb
```
Get from: Vercel Storage → Postgres → **Postgres Pooled Connection**

#### 2. DIRECT_URL
```
postgres://default:xxx@xxx.us-east-1.postgres.vercel-storage.com/verceldb
```
Get from: Vercel Storage → Postgres → **Postgres Direct Connection**

#### 3. NEXTAUTH_URL
```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app
```
Your Vercel production URL (check Deployments tab for exact URL)

#### 4. NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```bash
# Generate it:
node generate-secret.js
```
Copy the output and paste as the value

#### 5. OPENAI_API_KEY
```
sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Step 2: Create Postgres Database (if not created)

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → **Storage** → **Create Database**
2. Select **Postgres**
3. Name: `optigenius-db`
4. Region: **Washington D.C., USA (iad1)**
5. Click **Create**
6. Copy the connection strings and use them for Step 1 above

---

### Step 3: Trigger New Deployment

**Option A - Push Empty Commit:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\bensa\Documents\OptiGenius
git commit --allow-empty -m "Deploy with environment variables configured"
git push origin main
```

**Option B - Redeploy from Dashboard:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → **Deployments**
2. Click **•••** (three dots) on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Confirm

---

### Step 4: Watch Build Succeed

Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click on the new deployment

You should see:
```
✓ Cloning repository
✓ Installing dependencies
✓ Running build command
  → prisma generate ✓
  → next build ✓
✓ Build completed
✓ Deploying
✓ Ready: https://your-app.vercel.app
```

GitHub check will now show: ✅ **Success**

## 🔍 Verify Success

### On Vercel:
- ✅ Deployment shows green checkmark
- ✅ Status: "Ready"
- ✅ Visit URL works

### On GitHub:
- ✅ Latest commit shows green checkmark
- ✅ Check: "vercel/deployment — Success"

### On Your App:
- ✅ Homepage loads: https://your-app.vercel.app
- ✅ Can sign in: https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/signin
- ✅ Dashboard works after login

## 🆘 Still Failing?

### Check Environment Variables
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# Verify all 5 variables are set for ALL environments:
☑ Production
☑ Preview  
☑ Development
```

### Check Database
- Database must be created in Vercel Storage
- Must be in same region as deployment (iad1)
- Connection strings must be correct

### Check Build Logs
- Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click deployment → View Build Logs
- Look for specific error messages

### Common Issues

**"Missing DATABASE_URL"**
→ Environment variable not set or not set for correct environment

**"Can't connect to database"**
→ Database not created or connection string incorrect

**"NEXTAUTH_URL not configured"**
→ Set NEXTAUTH_URL to your exact production domain
