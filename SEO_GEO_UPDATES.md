## What is GEO?
**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of optimizing content for AI-powered search engines and chatbots like:

Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on keywords and meta tags, GEO focuses on:
- Content clarity and structure

- Sentence readability for AI comprehension
- Authoritative information that AI can cite

## Testing
To test the changes:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Analyze any website URL
4. Observe the clearly separated SEO and GEO sections in the results

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
- Add more GEO metrics as AI search evolves
- Implement A/B testing for GEO recommendations
- Add competitive GEO analysis
- Track GEO score improvements over time
