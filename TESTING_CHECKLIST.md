## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Test incrementally**: Don't wait to test everything at once
2. **Use real websites**: Test with actual URLs, not just examples
3. **Check console**: Always have DevTools open
4. **Test edge cases**: Try to break it!
5. **Get feedback**: Have someone else test it
6. **Document issues**: Write down what you find

**Happy Testing! 🧪✨**
