## Getting Started

## Tech

- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Minimal shadcn-style UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, Tabs)
- API route uses node-fetch + cheerio to parse HTML
- OpenAI API for AI-powered SEO insights and suggestions

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (or GitLab/Bitbucket)

2. **Import to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Alternative: Deploy via Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

### Environment Variables

For AI-powered insights, you need to set up your OpenAI API key:

1. **Local Development:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - Get your key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

2. **Vercel Deployment:**
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key value
   - Redeploy your application

**Note:** The app will work without the API key, but AI insights will not be available.
