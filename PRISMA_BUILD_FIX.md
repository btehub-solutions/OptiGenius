# Prisma Build Error Fix

## The Problem
```
Error: Missing required environment variable: DATABASE_URL
npm error command failed
npm error command sh -c prisma generate
```

This error occurred because:
1. The `postinstall` script runs `prisma generate` during `npm install`
2. During the install phase, environment variables are NOT yet available
3. Prisma requires `DATABASE_URL` to generate the client
4. Build fails before it even starts

## The Solution

✅ **Removed `postinstall` script** from `package.json`
✅ **Moved `prisma generate` to the `build` script** where env vars are available
✅ **Simplified `vercel.json`** to use the package.json build script

### Changes Made

**Before:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "postinstall": "prisma generate"
}
```

**After:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "prisma generate && next build"
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Install phase** (`npm install`): No Prisma generation, no env vars needed ✅
2. **Build phase** (`npm run build`): Environment variables are available, Prisma generates successfully ✅
3. **Runtime**: Prisma client is ready to use ✅

## Deploy Now

```bash
# Commit and push the fix
git add package.json vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix Prisma build error - move generate to build phase"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment. This time it should succeed!

## Verify Environment Variables Are Set

Before deploying, ensure these are set in **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**:

- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` (from Vercel Postgres)
- ✅ `DIRECT_URL` (from Vercel Postgres)
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_URL` (your production domain)
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` (from OpenAI)

## Expected Build Output

You should now see:
```
✓ Running "npm install"
✓ Running "npm run build"
  - Prisma generates successfully
  - Next.js builds successfully
✓ Build completed
✓ Deployment ready
```

## Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors:
1. Check that all environment variables are set in Vercel
2. Verify your Postgres database is created and accessible
3. Check the build logs for specific error messages
4. Ensure `prisma/schema.prisma` is committed to your repo
