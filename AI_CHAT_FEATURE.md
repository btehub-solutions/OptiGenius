    url: string;
    score: number;
    title: string;
    metaDescription: string;
    geoAnalysis: any;
    aiInsights: any;
    issues: string[];
    recommendations: string[];
  };
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

#### 2. **Chat API Endpoint** (`/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- POST endpoint for AI conversations
- Requires authentication
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model
- Maintains conversation history
- Context-aware system prompt

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "User's question",
  "context": { /* analysis data */ },
  "conversationHistory": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "..." }
  ]
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "AI assistant's response",

}
```

### Integration

The AI Chat Panel is integrated into the results page:

```tsx
<AIChatPanel
  analysisContext={{
    url: data.url,
    score: data.score,
    title: data.title,
    metaDescription: data.metaDescription,
    geoAnalysis: data.geoAnalysis,
    aiInsights: data.aiInsights,
    issues: data.issues,
    recommendations: data.recommendations,
  }}
  isAuthenticated={!!session}
/>
```

## Authentication

- **Unauthenticated Users**: See a prompt to sign in when clicking the chat button
- **Authenticated Users**: Full access to AI chat functionality
- API endpoint validates session before processing requests

## AI System Prompt

The AI is provided with:
- Current page URL and SEO score
- Page title and meta description
- GEO analysis scores and metrics
- Top 5 issues and recommendations
- AI insights summary (if available)

The AI is instructed to:
1. Answer follow-up questions about the analysis
2. Provide specific, actionable advice
3. Explain SEO and GEO concepts clearly
4. Help rewrite meta descriptions, titles, or content
5. Be concise but thorough
6. Always reference specific data from the analysis

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Low Score
**User**: "Why is my SEO score low?"

**AI**: "Your SEO score is 45/100, which needs improvement. The main issues are:
1. Missing meta description (costs 20 points)
2. Multiple H1 tags found (3 instead of 1)
3. Only 2 images have alt text out of 15 total

I recommend starting with adding a compelling meta description between 120-160 characters, as this will immediately boost your score and improve click-through rates."

### Example 2: Rewriting Meta Description
**User**: "Rewrite my meta description for AI ranking"

**AI**: "Based on your page about [topic], here's an AI-optimized meta description:

'[Optimized description with clear value proposition, relevant keywords, and factual information]'

This version:
- Is 145 characters (optimal length)
- Includes specific entities and facts
- Uses clear, direct language AI engines prefer
- Highlights unique value proposition"

### Example 3: GEO Improvement
**User**: "How can I improve my GEO score?"

**AI**: "Your GEO score is 62/100. Here are the priority improvements:

1. **Sentence Clarity (18/30)**: Your average sentence length is 32 words. Break complex sentences into 15-20 word chunks for better AI comprehension.

2. **Factual Density (8/20)**: Only 4 named entities detected. Add specific people, organizations, or products mentioned in your content.

3. **Content Length (12/15)**: At 280 words, you're just under the 300-word minimum. Add 50-100 words of relevant detail.

These changes could boost your GEO score to 80+."

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Limits**: Responses capped at 1000 tokens to ensure fast responses
- **Context Size**: Only essential analysis data sent to reduce API costs
- **Conversation History**: Full history maintained for context
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **URL Comparison**: Allow users to compare two analyzed URLs
2. **Export Chat**: Save conversation as PDF or text
3. **Voice Input**: Add speech-to-text for questions
4. **Suggested Actions**: Quick-action buttons for common tasks
5. **Learning Mode**: Tutorial-style explanations for beginners
6. **Multi-language**: Support for non-English queries
7. **Chat History**: Persist conversations across sessions

## Styling

The chat panel uses:
- Gradient backgrounds (purple-to-blue theme)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Shadow effects for depth
- Responsive sizing
- Accessible color contrasts
- Lucide React icons
