## Why GitHub Pages Won't Work

### What GitHub Pages Is
- **Static file hosting** - Serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- **No server** - Just a CDN that delivers files
- **Perfect for:** Documentation, portfolios, landing pages, Jekyll blogs

### What OptiGenius Needs
- **Node.js runtime** - To execute server-side code
- **API endpoints** - `/api/analyze`, `/api/auth`, `/api/chat`
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Server-side rendering** - Dynamic page generation
- **Authentication** - NextAuth sessions

### What Happens When You Try
```
❌ API routes return 404
❌ Database connections fail
❌ Authentication doesn't work
❌ Dynamic pages show errors
❌ Only static HTML renders (if at all)
```
